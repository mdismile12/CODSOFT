## Overview

During my internship at CODSOFT, I built three projects to strengthen my front-end development skillsâ€”each focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

1. **Landing Page**: A responsive and visually engaging homepage.  
2. **Portfolio Website**: A personal showcase of my skills, experience, and projects.  
3. **Calculator App**: A basic calculator capable of performing arithmetic operations.

These projects highlight my ability to create clean, user-friendly web interfaces.
