üéì<br> I'm currently a 3rd year Computer Engineering student with a passion for innovative tech projects that solve real-world problems. From Under-developing a women's safety smart wearable device using ESP32 and GPS/GSM modules to building unique/creative Websites, automated railway safety systems, and even an Academics Website, I love blending Software , and Hardware (sometimes) to make tech more meaningful.<br>
<br>
üöÄ I‚Äôve participated in hackathons, explored new techs for development, IoT, smart automation, and AI-driven safety systems, and I'm always excited to work on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with latest tech, frameworks, microcontrollers, sensors, and creative coding.<br>
<br>
ü§ù I‚Äôm open to collaborations, internships, and learning opportunities in the fields of Web-development, App development through MIT , IoT, AI, embedded systems, and human-centered tech.</p><br>
